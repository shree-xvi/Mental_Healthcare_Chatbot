            <p align="center" className="health-p">Mental health chatbots are AI-powered tools that provide mental health support, information, and resources to users through natural language conversations. We came up with the solution of chatbot that can offer a range of services, including screening for mental health conditions, providing coping strategies.The chatbot can be interactive generating audio video based solutions increasing effectiveness. At any point if we feel that the patient might commit self-harm of any kind or any issue that is beyond the scope of AI we will alert the authorities and connect him/her to the right medical services.On top of that ,we'll be ensuring full privacy of the user on our platform as mental health is a very sensitive subject.This will help  users to express their mental issues  anytime and anywhere, without the fear of judgment or stigma.
